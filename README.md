# Chronovox Studio
Open sourced Voxel Editor, written by Nick Mead

***This project has only been tested on Windows 10***

This project was made using C++ Visual Studio 2017, later updated to VS 2019 (just launch in VS 2017 if that's what you have)

**Summary:** Chronovox Studio is an editor for voxels, or cubes, that offers a quick and easy way to create voxel models.  Useful keybinds can be found by mousing over elements or by checking the menubar buttons, excluding some debug ones mentioned in Test Features below.  This is an ongoing project, and aspects may change in future updates such as file formats, though they should be backwards compatible.

**How to Compile:**

	1. Run "copy-res.bat" to copy the res folder to each bin directory (Only necessary for Release and Release-Console)
	2. Open "Voxel Model Editor.sln" in Visual Studio
	3. Select configuration (Debug and Release-Console have Windows consoles, Release and Release-Console run faster)
	4. Build and compile

**Test Features:** Change the colors of the GUI by editting the file "res\ColorTheme.ini" (press 'o' to reload with the editor open, do Step 1 if running Release or Release-Console)

**Bugs:** If you run into any bugs or other issues during use, or have suggestions, please create a new issue on the project GitHub (https://github.com/NickM13/Chronovox-Studio)
