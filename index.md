## What is it?

Chronovox Studio is a C++ open-source voxel editor, featuring it’s own optimized file format (.csm), as well as the option to export to a few widely known model formats (.obj, .ply, .stl).  It uses a simple and easy to use interface, developed from scratch specifically for this project.

Although it doesn’t have all of the tools one might need, the script generation feature allows for creating unique shapes based on written scripts.  To add your own script, locate the “res/script/generate” folder, create your LUA file, and reload the editor have it show under the generate menu.  More information on functions and variables can be found [here](https://nickvoxel.com/chronovox-studio/generation-script/).
